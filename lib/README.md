## Dependencies

Most embedded platforms come with preconfigured versions of MbedTLS. If MbedTLS is not globally available (e.g. Ubuntu), clone the project here into a new folder `mbedtls` and check it out to `v2.28.1`:

```shell
cd lib
git clone https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls
cd mbedtls
git checkout v2.28.1
```
